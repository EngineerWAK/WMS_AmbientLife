# WMS_AmbientLife
Create a bunch of little dudes driving (flying?) around the map. No combat stuff for now.<br/>

WMS Ambient Life (civilian by default) should provide some roaming NPC driving around the map and later on probably flying.<br/>
Mostly build to fill empty map running with DFO standalone, would be useless with WMS_InfantryProgram since it use it's own roaming system.<br/>
You can obviously use armed vehicles and change the faction to get hostile roaming units.<br/>
	
Start Ambient Life from initServer.sqf<br/>
```
if (true)then {execVM "WMS_AL_Functions.sqf"};
```
